	<h3>Sister</h3>

		<p>My sister Katelyn and I are very close. We have been close for my entire life. She is three years older than I am. <br> This allowed us to be in the same school in high school and college. When I was a freshman, she was a senior. <br> Some siblings would avoid each other like the plague, but she would always come up and say hi or hug me when we ran into each other.</p>
		<p>Katelyn is a big part of my life and a role model for me. 
	
	<h3>Mother</h3>

	<img src = "./Images/mom.jpg" height = 300px>

	<p>My mom is also a huge part of my life. She is the person that keeps me sane and drives me insane at the same time. Ironic right? <br> But her work ethic and determination in any project she encounters has truly taught me how to be successful.<br>
	While at times she can get on my nerves, it is out of love and the older I become, the more I can see that.</p>
	
	<h3>Father</h3>

	<img src = "./Images/fam.jpg" height = 300px>
	<p>My dad was a huge role model growing up. He was the one who taught me sports, even coaching many of my childhood teams. <br> Whether it was baseball, basketball, or soccer, he would always be there to not just help me get better but to have fun. <br>
	We still bond over sports but he has also showed me a look into the business world.</p>
	
	<h3>Grandpa Leo</h3>

	<img src = "./Images/grandpaleo.jpg" height = 300px>
	<p>If I were to pick one person that I admire and want to aspire to it would be my grandpa Leo. The way he carries himself with a smile on his face and always easy to talk to. <br>
	He has taught me so much in my life. From the macro level of life morals to the micro level of construction and music. <br> Between giving me trombone lessons or letting me be his assistant in his construction projects I have learn so much and will never forget his lessons.</p>
	
	<h3>Grandma Goofy</h3>
	<img src = "./Images/goofy.jpg" height = 300px>
	<img src = "./Images/leoglor.jpg" height = 300px>
	<p>Grandma Goofy is exactly what she sounds like. She is goofy. Her really name is Gloria but when my sister was little she called Gloria grandma goofy and it stuck. <br>
	She is kind hearted and makes me delicious cookies and bars. She is always supportive and a joy to be around. </p>
	
	<h3>Lauren Cook-Bottem</h3>

	<p> Lauren is my future wife. She is cool.</p>
