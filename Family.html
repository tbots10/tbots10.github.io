		<p>My sister Katelyn and I are very close. We have been close for my entire life. She is three years older than I am. This allowed us to be in the same school in high school and college. When I was a freshman, she was a senior. Some siblings would avoid each other like the plague, but she would always come up and say hi or hug me when we ran into each other.</p>
		<p>Katelyn is a big part of my life and a role model for me.
