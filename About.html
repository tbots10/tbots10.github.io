<h1>Thomas Bottem</h1>
<p> Hello! My name is Thomas Bottem. I am a senior at Luther College in Decorah, Iowa (class of 2015). I am a psychology and sociology double major.</p>

<h3>Hobbies</h3>
<p>I grew up playing all kinds of sports. However, baseball, basketball, and soccer were my main ones. Once I hit high school, sports started getting much more competitive. <br>
This made me realize the only way to keep up was to chose a sport and stick to it year round. From eighth grade up until junior year of high school, I played soccer year round, doing indoor training in the winter. <br>
Senior year, I was too busy with my trombone playing to play soccer. I was in the top jazz band at my high school and in the top jazz band in the twin cities call Minnesota Youth Jazz Band. <br> 
It was a great experience and I even got to tour Europe with the band and play at Montreaux Jazz Festival in Switzerland. <br>
In college, I played intramural soccer and some ultimate frisbee. I also do enjoy video games. They have been a great stress relief during my time in college.
